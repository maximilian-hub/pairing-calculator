# pairing-calculator
Prototype of a flavor pairing calculator with dummy data. Inspired by Karen Page and Andrew Dornenburg's "The Flavor Bible," which provides an amazing reference for which ingredients pair well with others. I wanted to be able to quickly look up the pairings shared by multiple ingredients, so I made this. On hiatus until I figure out a better way to import & model the data.
